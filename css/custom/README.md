# Custom CSS folder in Mandala Kadence

This folder is where site developers can place custom CSS sheets for their site. Any file with the extension `.css` 
will be added to the site. However, all files in this directory (other than this README) will be ignored by git.

To create a theme for a specific site, fork this repo and remove the .gitignore here. Then the fork can save 
custom stylesheets in its repo.
