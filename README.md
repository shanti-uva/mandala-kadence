# Mandala Kadence
A child theme of Kadence for Mandala-based sites and their subsites

## 
## Styles
CSS styles are written in SCSS locally using the WP-SCSS plugin which compiles and saves the css, which will also 
be included in the git repo to be used by production sites.

The media-queries.scss file is taken from https://github.com/Necromancerx/media-queries-scss-mixins and the use of 
those media queries is documented in that repo.
